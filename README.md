This project provides both [OpenAPI](./specs/oh-dear.openapi.yaml) and [Arazzo](./specs/oh-dear.arazzo.yaml) specifications for the excellent [Oh Dear! monitoring service](https://ohdear.app).

## Specifications

The OpenAPI specification follows the [v3.1.0 standard](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0), making it easy to generate client SDKs,
server stubs, Postman collections, documentation, and more. It is particularly useful for building robust [third-party integrations](https://ohdear.app/docs/integrations/3rd-party-integrations-of-oh-dear) and [SDKs](https://ohdear.app/docs/integrations/the-oh-dear-php-sdk).

The Arazzo specification follows the [v1.0.1 standard](https://github.com/OAI/Arazzo-Specification/blob/main/versions/1.0.1.md), and defines how the API works in real-world scenarios. It describes workflows that require one or more steps with request/response series. A primary benefit is providing the ability to programmatically test the OpenAPI specification.

## Development

The OpenAPI specification file was created using [Stoplight Studio](https://stoplight.io/studio/), GPT-5, and manual editing in VSCode. The documentation and PHP SDK source code were treated as the source of truth.

The Arazzo specification was initially generated by `@redocly/cli` from the OpenAPI specification, then manually edited in VSCode to ensure accuracy and completeness.

## Status

The specifications are a work in progress. The OpenAPI specification is approximately 95% complete, while the Arazzo specification is around 70% complete.
Keep an eye on the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and the issue tracker for updates.
