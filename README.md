This project provides both [OpenAPI](./specs/oh-dear.openapi.yaml) and [Arazzo](./specs/oh-dear.arazzo.yaml) specifications for the excellent [Oh Dear! monitoring service](https://ohdear.app).

## About Oh Dear

[Oh Dear!](https://ohdear.app) is an all-in-one monitoring tool for your websites. It offers uptime monitoring, SSL certificate checking, broken link detection, scheduled task monitoring, and much more. This project aims to provide comprehensive, community-driven API specifications to make integrations with Oh Dear! a breeze.

## Specifications

### OpenAPI

The OpenAPI specification follows the [v3.1.0 standard](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0). It provides a detailed, machine-readable description of the Oh Dear! API. This makes it easy to:

- Generate client SDKs for various programming languages.
- Create server stubs for testing and development.
- Produce interactive API documentation.
- Import into tools like Postman for easy API exploration.

It is particularly useful for building robust [third-party integrations](https://ohdear.app/docs/integrations/3rd-party-integrations-of-oh-dear) and [SDKs](https://ohdear.app/docs/integrations/the-oh-dear-php-sdk).

### Arazzo

The Arazzo specification follows the [v1.0.1 standard](https://github.com/OAI/Arazzo-Specification/blob/main/versions/1.0.1.md) and defines how the API works in real-world scenarios. It describes workflows that require one or more steps with request/response series. A primary benefit is providing the ability to programmatically test the OpenAPI specification and ensure that API workflows behave as expected.

## Repository Structure

A quick overview of the most relevant files and directories:

```text
├── specs/
│   ├── oh-dear.openapi.yaml   # Primary OpenAPI 3.1 specification
│   └── oh-dear.arazzo.yaml    # Arazzo 1.0.1 workflow specification
├── config/
│   ├── .spectral.yaml           # Spectral configuration for linting the OpenAPI spec
│   └── vacuum-ruleset.yaml    # Custom ruleset used for additional quality linting
├── assets/                    # Logos and images used in the README/docs
├── package.json               # Lint scripts and dependencies (Spectral & Redocly CLI)
└── README.md
```

- `specs/` contains the source-of-truth API contract files. Any change here should ideally be validated via the lint commands and—where applicable—reflected in downstream SDKs or docs.
- `config/.spectral.yaml` configures [Spectral](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral) for linting the OpenAPI specification.
- `config/vacuum-ruleset.yaml` is an extended quality ruleset (Vacuum) enforcing style, documentation completeness, schema rigor, and structural integrity on top of default linters.
- `assets/` stores project branding and visual resources.

## Usage

To use these specifications, you'll need Node.js and npm installed. First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/permafrost-dev/oh-dear-openapi-spec.git
cd oh-dear-openapi-spec
npm install
```

### Generating Documentation

You can generate beautiful, interactive API documentation from the OpenAPI specification using tools like [Redocly](https://redocly.com/):

```bash
npx @redocly/cli build-docs specs/oh-dear.openapi.yaml
```

This will generate a `redoc-static.html` file in the root of the project.

### Generating SDKs

A wide range of tools can generate client SDKs from OpenAPI specifications. One popular option is the [OpenAPI Generator CLI](https://openapi-generator.tech/).

For example, to generate a TypeScript SDK:

```bash
npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \
  -i specs/oh-dear.openapi.yaml -g typescript-axios \
  -o ./generated-sdk/ts
```

## Validation

This project uses multiple layers of validation to ensure specification quality:

1. **Spectral** (`@stoplight/spectral-cli`) – General OpenAPI best practice and style conformance.
2. **Redocly CLI** (`@redocly/cli`) – Structural validation and bundling consistency.
3. [**Vacuum**](https://github.com/daveshanley/vacuum) – An ultra-super-fast, lightweight OpenAPI linter and quality checking tool. Enhanced quality checks: description presence & duplication, schema typing, path ambiguity, enum uniqueness, security-related markdown hygiene, and naming conventions.

Run all standard validations:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Run individually:

```bash
npm run lint:open-api   # Lints specs/oh-dear.openapi.yaml via Spectral
npm run lint:arazzo     # Lints specs/oh-dear.arazzo.yaml via Redocly CLI
```

## Development

The OpenAPI specification file was created using [Stoplight Studio](https://stoplight.io/studio/), GPT-5, and manual editing in VSCode. The official Oh Dear! documentation and PHP SDK source code were treated as the source of truth.

The Arazzo specification was initially generated by `@redocly/cli` from the OpenAPI specification, then manually edited in VSCode to ensure accuracy and completeness.

## Status

The specifications are a work in progress. The OpenAPI specification is approximately 95% complete, while the Arazzo specification is around 70% complete. Keep an eye on the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and the issue tracker for updates.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a pull request or create an issue for any bugs, suggestions, or questions you may have. See the [issue tracker](https://github.com/permafrost-dev/oh-dear-openapi-spec/issues) for a list of open items.

When contributing changes to the specs:

- Run `npm run lint` before opening a PR.
- Keep descriptions meaningful—avoid duplication.
- Favor reusable components where appropriate (consider refactoring repeated schema fragments).
- If adding workflows, ensure Arazzo steps align with existing operationIds.

## Changelog

Please see [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more information on what has changed recently.
