This project provides a complete [OpenAPI v3.1.0](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0) specification for the API of the excellent
[Oh Dear! monitoring service](https://ohdear.app).

## Specification

The specification follows the [OpenAPI 3.1 standard](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0), making it easy to generate client SDKs,
server stubs, Postman collections, documentation, and more. It is particularly useful for building robust [third-party integrations](https://ohdear.app/docs/integrations/3rd-party-integrations-of-oh-dear) 
and [SDKs](https://ohdear.app/docs/integrations/the-oh-dear-php-sdk).

## Development

The specification file was created using [Stoplight Studio](https://stoplight.io/studio/), GPT-5, and manual editing in VSCode. The documentation and PHP SDK source code were treated as its source of truth.
