This project provides both [OpenAPI v3.1](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0) and Arazzo v1.x specifications for the API of the excellent
[Oh Dear! monitoring service](https://ohdear.app).

## Specifications

The OpenAPI specification follows the [OpenAPI 3.1 standard](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0), making it easy to generate client SDKs,
server stubs, Postman collections, documentation, and more. It is particularly useful for building robust [third-party integrations](https://ohdear.app/docs/integrations/3rd-party-integrations-of-oh-dear) 
and [SDKs](https://ohdear.app/docs/integrations/the-oh-dear-php-sdk).

The Arazzo specification follows the [Arazzo v1.0.1 standard](https://github.com/OAI/Arazzo-Specification/blob/main/versions/1.0.1.md), defines how the API should work in practice. It describes scenarios that require multiple steps with requests and responses, providing a practical way to ensure that the OpenAPI specification is accurate. Additionally, it helps provide clarity on how the API behaves in real-world situations.

## Development

The OpenAPI specification file was created using [Stoplight Studio](https://stoplight.io/studio/), GPT-5, and manual editing in VSCode. The documentation and PHP SDK source code were treated as the source of truth.

The Arazzo specification was initially generated by `@redocly/cli` from the OpenAPI specification, then manually edited in VSCode to ensure accuracy and completeness.
